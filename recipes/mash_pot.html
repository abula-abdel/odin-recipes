        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>2 lbs potatoes (Yukon Gold for creamy, Russet for fluffy — or mix both)</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>½ cup milk or heavy cream (warm it before using)</li>
                <li>Salt, to taste</li>
                <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            
        <h4>Prep the Potatoes</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Peel potatoes (or leave some skin on if you like texture).</li>
                <li>Cut into even chunks (about 1–2 inches).</li>
                <li>Rinse once to remove excess starch.</li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Boil until very tender</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Add potatoes to a large pot and cover with cold water.</li>
                <li>Add 1 tablespoon salt to the water.</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium and cook for 15–20 minutes until fork-tender.</li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Drain and dry</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Drain potatoes well.</li>
                <li>Return them to the warm pot for 1–2 minutes to let steam escape — this makes creamier mash.</li>
            </ol>    

        <h4>Mash the potatoes</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>Add butter first so it melts into the potatoes.</li>
                <li>Mash using a masher, whisk, or ricer.</li>
                <li>Slowly pour in warm milk/cream while mashing until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
            </ol>

        <h4>Season and finish</h4>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Add optional sour cream or chives if using.</li>
                <li>Mix gently — don’t over-mix or they can become gluey.</li>
            </ol>
